# DeepCNV: A Deep Learning Approach for Authenticating Copy Number Variants
For any question about this repo, please contact Xiurui Hou (xh256@njit.edu).  

## Description
We propose a deep learning approach to remove the false positive CNV calls from PennCNV program. This repo constains the model code and an executable script with five sample inputs. Since the model file exceeds the upload size of Github, it can be accessed by this external [link](https://www.filehosting.org/file/details/833894/DeepCNV.hdf5). The dataset of this project is not for public.
